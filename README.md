Q:
First of all we need to add a button of multiplication to the XML file. After doing this, we need to add a the logic part of multiplication to the SIMPLECALCULATOR files. The last thing to do is to add to find the button in the MainActivity file, and create listener for him (with the logic in SIMPLECALCULATOR).

We need to add tests of the multiplication login in the simpleCalculatorTest, then add tests to MainActivityTest after updating the activity.
In the end add tests of the flow, test with multiplication flow.
